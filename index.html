            <h3>The no-nonsense guide to digital marketing strategy for higher education institutions.</h3>
            <hr id="header">
            <div id="body">
                <p>In the beginning, there was the <span class="boom">web guy</span>. You may know this guy. In fact, you may be this guy. </p>
                <p>The web guy was some sort of computer wizard sent from space to immediately perform each and every content edit that came across his or her desk. </p>
                <p>They performed miracles making web pages prettier, readable and current. Having a web guy meant you could move onto more important things like press releases for that recent faculty grant or drafting letters from the Dean.</p>
                <p>Well I have some sad news for you.</p>
                <p class="boom">The web guy is dead.</p>
                <p>These days we are replacing terms like “web edits” with concepts such as “content strategy”. Updating web pages now consist of keyword research and page optimization. Discussions about advertising in scholarly journals are now abstract conversations about paid search, display ads and retargeting tactics. The focus has shifted from readership to click through rates. From leads to conversions and from recruiting events to social strategy. </p>
                <p class="boom">Higher-ed marketing is digital marketing. </p>
                <p>To compete, colleges and universities have to develop complex digital strategies to be seen in an intensely competitive space. They need to develop the skills to plan and execute targeted campaigns and measure online interactions. You can’t afford to watch from the sidelines. </p>
                <p>Problem is, <span class="boom">there is no playbook</span>! </p>
                <p>No guidelines, no standard operating procedure. Just hundreds of “experts” with their hands out trapping you into expensive contracts with such innovative ideas as “You know… you should be on Snapchat.” </p>
                <p>Common people. We are better than that. We are much more capable. We can make small changes, right now to move in the right direction. It’s possible, I promise.. I’ve seen it and I’ve done it. </p>
                <p>All we need is a playbook. <span class="boom">One did not exist, so I made one.</span></p>
                <p>With the concepts, resources and best practices found in this playbook, you can create an in-house digital agency using your existing resources. You can outsmart, out marketing and outshine your competitors. You can attract the right student to your degree offerings and you <span class="boom">can start today</span>! And oh yeah… you can bring the web guy along too. </p>
                <p>The Higher Ed Digital Strategy Playbook is unlike anything you have read. It is as direct as it can be. It is not full of uninteresting and uninspired case studies. It is not littered with complex industry terminology or marketing mumbo jumbo. It is simply page after page of straightforward actionable insights tailored specifically to higher ed marketers, recruiters and communicators. </p>
                <p>This is the missing manual. The secret weapon, the ace in the hole. </p>
                <p class="boom">This is the playbook. </p>
                <p><span class="boom">The Higher Ed Digital Strategy Playbook</span> is the first of it’s kind. It is full of proven tactics and techniques that the agencies and consultants won’t reveal. Most importantly it is tailored directly to higher ed marketers and communicators! No broad concepts that leave you guessing in terms of how to apply them. Straight talk, to help you improve your marketing today!</p>
                <p>After ten years in the higher-ed web and digital marketing world these tactics work. They will help you create a strategy that you can lean on and build on in the future. </p>
